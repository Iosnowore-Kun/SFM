Heavy wants spy to brush his hair. Spy laughs because heavy doesn't even have any hair.
Shrek pops up behind heavy and throws him into the air. Coach starts dancing randomly to dubstep,
Nick finds it amusing. Shrek pops up behind coach and blows him up with a bomb. 5 Scouts hear
the bomb explosion and race to see what's going on. When they arrive they see Shrek with 2 miniguns,
1 in each hand. The scouts get out weapons of their own. Scout calls Shrek a knuckle head and angers
him. Shrek takes offence in that and yells out, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON MY SWAMP!". Then shrek fires his
guns, killing all the scouts in seconds. Three African-Americans Eat Watermelon and KFC, while Coach is one of
them, he wonders where Tyrone is and why he hasn't showed up to see them. None of the others know and go on
with eating their food. Suddenly Coach hears an alarm and asked what that alarm was for, none of them knew.
Suddenly out of nowhere, Shrek shows up floating to them. Coach is shocked and scared, not knowing what to do.
Shrek then gets out a sword and waves his head around. Shrek then throws his sword at Coach. The sword goes right
through his head and kills him. Shrek then goes into his escape pod and flys to the planet Endor.
